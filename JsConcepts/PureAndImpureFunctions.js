//Pure function
//1. One that is deterministic in nature(produces same output for same input every time)
//2. No Side effects (does not change anything in the global scope/state)
//can be used for processing some data that does not involve changing the state of the global scope/variables

//Impure Function
//1. One that is non-deterministic in nature(produces different output for same input)
//2. Side effects (does change in the global scope/state)
//can be used to mutate the state of the globla scope/variables -> like api call to fetch data and update existing state
